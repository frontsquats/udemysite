  <h3>Services</h3>
  <p>The average projects we work on consist of mixing and or mastering. This typically includes the editing, mixing, and mastering. It is also possible to do either of these things separately. Both digital and vinyl mastering is available too.
    <br>
    Also included in this stage is the sequencing (putting the songs in order and solidifying their transitions) followed by preparing them for different formats (digital, vinyl, tape, etc.).
    <br>
    Typically, mastering is done by engineers who specialize in this field and therefore takes place at studios that are specifically built for this purpose. Clean Laundry Studios is not a mastering house, and I am not a mastering engineer. That
    being said, mastering services are available for a fraction of the cost of most mastering studios. The quality is astonishingly similar.

  <h3>Mastering</h3>
  <p>Mastering is a process that takes a completed mix and optimizes it to sound the best it possibly can through as many different playback systems as possible. Depending on the overall quality of the mix, mastering could mean a lot of heavy
    processing to simply making the mix louder with minimal processing.</p>
